## Sync For Science

### Who benefits from S4S?

#### Research Participants

An easier way of contributing to scientific progress and sharing medical
records with researchers that doesn’t require faxed forms, delays, or in-person
visits.

#### Researchers

A simple path to receive research participants’ basic clinical data, including
essential details like lab results, vital signs, problem lists, medications,
and immunizations, potentially increasing participation in studies. Data
delivered in a structured format with standard vocabularies may also need less
“cleanup” than typical EHR data.

#### Providers

A way to give patients access to the potential benefit from participating in
research studies and a reduction in staff time to support data requests, as
they flow automatically through our vendor-supplied patient portal.

#### EHR Vendors

A method to empower their health care provider customers, to facilitate
research, to participate in the development of stronger health care systems,
and to meet EHR Incentive Program requirements for API-based patient access.
